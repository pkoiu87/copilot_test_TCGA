# TCGA Breast Cancer Subtype Extraction Project

## Overview
The TCGA Breast Cancer Subtype Extraction Project aims to analyze the genomic and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to classify breast cancer subtypes. The primary goal is to identify and characterize distinct molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which can aid in personalized treatment strategies.

## Objectives
- To extract DNA and RNA sequencing data from TCGA for breast cancer samples.
- To classify samples into subtypes based on identified genomic features.
- To visualize and interpret the results to gain insights into breast cancer biology.

## Methodology
1. **Data Acquisition**: Utilize TCGA's portal to download genomic and clinical data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure its quality and relevance.
3. **Subtype Classification**: Apply various machine learning algorithms and statistical methods to classify the samples into distinct subtypes.
4. **Results Visualization**: Use visualization techniques to present the findings effectively.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python, R
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Sources**: TCGA Data Portal
